      <h3>SAE J2707 Wear Test Procdeure on Inertia Dynamometer</h3>
      <section>
      <h4>Foreword</h4>
      <p>
      The SAE J2707 is a recommended practice widely used around the globe. New testing methods and equipment do not affect the execution of the procedure. 
      The SAE J2707 is intended to harmonize test procedures for simulating and evaluating  wear characteristics of automotive brake lining and pads that relate to real world conditions of vehicle on the market.
   </section>
  
   <section>
    <h4>Objective</h4>
    <p>
      Brake wear life, its respective dynamics, and behavior under different temperatures and speeds are critical to the successful development and production of commercially available disc brake pads and linings, both for the OEM equipment and aftermarket. 
      The evaluation for the wear characteristics is also critical given friction material and its mating part when subjected to a series of brake stops derived from real world driving patterns. 
      Different permutations of speed, temperature, and deceleration foreseeable in driving situations are utilized to yield different levels of wear and transfer later phenomena.
      When tested under controlled conditions, these driving pattern combinations should provide valuable insight on the wear behavior and level of given lining and rotor or drum combination.

      </div>
      <p><i>Description</i>: This graph represents brake fade and shows how the friction level for a test section performs over the number of stops in the cycle. This shows how consistent the brakes are over time</p>
      <div>
        <img src="{{fig2_2}}" alt="third graph">
      </div>
      <p><i>Description</i>: This graph is the same as the previous but provides information for a different set of test sections. Again, results show the brakes are very consistent with their friction level per test section. But as expected, the trend shows that the friction level is beginning to fade/drop more after every test section</p>

        <img src="{{fig2_3}}" alt="third graph">
      </div>
      <p><i>Description</i>: This graph shows the relationship between Friction level and the final temperature(temperature after deaccelerating the rotor) for each test section. It is presented in a line graph format. It depicts a trend of higher friction levels for higher final temperatures suggesting that the brakes can continue to perform under harder braking conditions</p>
